# React Challenge  
## Medical Appointment Portal

**Focus:** Frontend only (React)  
**Goal:** Build a realistic, responsive web app simulating a medical appointment system.

---

## Context

A private clinic wants to modernize its appointment process.  
They hired you to create a **simple and intuitive web portal** where patients can:

1. Search for doctors by specialty or name  
2. View doctor details  
3. Choose a date and time  
4. Confirm the appointment  
5. Switch between languages (e.g., English / Arabic)
6. Toggle between light and dark themes

 You need to plan the design!

 Backend is **not required** â€” data can come from a **local JSON file**.

**Good luck, developers!**
